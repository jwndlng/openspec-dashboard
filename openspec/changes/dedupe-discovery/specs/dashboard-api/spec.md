## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Config endpoints
`GET /api/config` SHALL return the config. `PUT /api/config` SHALL validate the body (absolute paths for `scanRoots`, `ignorePaths` and `repos[].path`, `pollIntervalSeconds >= 10`, unique repo ids, each repo `id` matching its canonical path), canonicalise all paths, persist it atomically, and return the saved config; invalid bodies MUST return `400` with a message and leave the config unchanged. A body without `ignorePaths` SHALL be accepted and saved with `ignorePaths: []`. If the set of enabled repos changed, a scan MUST be triggered.

#### Scenario: Invalid interval
- **WHEN** `PUT /api/config` is called with `pollIntervalSeconds: 1`
- **THEN** the response is `400` and the stored config is unchanged

#### Scenario: Relative ignore path is rejected
- **WHEN** `PUT /api/config` is called with `ignorePaths: ["relative/dir"]`
- **THEN** the response is `400` naming `ignorePaths.0` and the stored config is unchanged

#### Scenario: Paths are stored canonically
- **WHEN** `PUT /api/config` is called with a scan root given as `~/Workspace/alpha/` or through a symlink
- **THEN** the returned and stored config contain the canonical absolute path without a trailing separator

#### Scenario: Duplicate directory is rejected
- **WHEN** `PUT /api/config` is called with two repos whose paths resolve to the same directory
- **THEN** the response is `400` reporting a duplicate repo id

### Requirement: Discover endpoint
`POST /api/discover` SHALL run discovery and return `{ candidates: [...], errors: [...] }`. The request MAY carry a JSON body with `scanRoots` and/or `ignorePaths`; when present they are used instead of the configured values, and each entry MUST be an absolute path after `~` expansion, otherwise the response MUST be `400` with a message. With no body the configured values are used. `candidates` SHALL contain only repositories found under the roots, outside the ignore paths, whose canonical path is not already in the saved config, each with `id`, canonical `path`, default `name` and `enabled: false`, sorted by path, and never the same directory twice. A candidate that shares its normalised `origin` remote with other known repositories SHALL carry `sameRemoteAs`, a list of `{ name, path, tracked }` for those repositories; otherwise the field is absent. `errors` SHALL list per-root problems. The endpoint MUST NOT persist anything and MUST NOT modify the in-memory config.

#### Scenario: Discover without saving
- **WHEN** `POST /api/discover` finds two new repos and the client never calls `PUT /api/config`
- **THEN** `GET /api/config` does not include the two repos

#### Scenario: Roots from the request body
- **WHEN** the saved config has no scan roots and `POST /api/discover` is called with `{ "scanRoots": ["/abs/workspace"] }`
- **THEN** the response lists the repositories under `/abs/workspace` as candidates and `GET /api/config` still returns empty `scanRoots`

#### Scenario: Ignore paths from the request body
- **WHEN** `POST /api/discover` is called with `{ "scanRoots": ["/abs/workspace"], "ignorePaths": ["/abs/workspace/mirror"] }`
- **THEN** no candidate has a path at or below `/abs/workspace/mirror` and `GET /api/config` still returns the saved `ignorePaths`

#### Scenario: Configured repos are not candidates
- **WHEN** the config already contains a repository at `/abs/workspace/a` (enabled or disabled) and discovery finds `/abs/workspace/a` and `/abs/workspace/b`
- **THEN** `candidates` contains only `/abs/workspace/b`

#### Scenario: Same directory through two roots
- **WHEN** `POST /api/discover` is called with two roots that resolve to the same directory
- **THEN** each repository below it appears once in `candidates`

#### Scenario: Shared remote is reported
- **WHEN** the config contains `/abs/a` and discovery finds `/abs/mirror/a` with the same `origin` remote
- **THEN** the candidate `/abs/mirror/a` has `sameRemoteAs` containing `{ "name": "a", "path": "/abs/a", "tracked": true }`

#### Scenario: Relative root is rejected
- **WHEN** `POST /api/discover` is called with `{ "scanRoots": ["relative/path"] }`
- **THEN** the response is `400` with a message and no walk is performed

#### Scenario: Missing root is reported, not fatal
- **WHEN** `POST /api/discover` is called with one existing and one non-existent root
- **THEN** the response is `200`, `errors` names the non-existent root, and `candidates` contains the repositories under the existing root

### Requirement: The dashboard never writes to tracked repositories
The dashboard MUST NOT write to a tracked repository except in response to an explicit user action, and then only as enumerated here: (1) `openspec/config.yaml`, where only the managed sections of the `context` and `rules` keys are modified (applying shared OpenSpec config profiles); (2) for agent sessions, creating a git worktree and its branch for a session (`git worktree add`, preceded by `git worktree prune`), with the worktree's directory placed under `~/.openspec-dashboard/worktrees/` and never inside the repository's working tree, and removing such a worktree with a non-forcing `git worktree remove` after the user confirmed and read-only checks proved that it holds no uncommitted change and no commit that exists nowhere else. Apart from those worktree commands the dashboard MUST NOT delete or move anything in a tracked repository, MUST NOT change the main checkout's branch, index or working tree, and MUST NOT contact a remote. All other filesystem writes MUST be confined to `~/.openspec-dashboard/`. Scanning, polling, discovery, previews and saving any dashboard setting MUST NOT write to a tracked repository. Apart from the worktree commands above, git MUST only be invoked with read-only subcommands (`rev-parse`, `log`, `worktree list`, `status`, `show-ref`, `symbolic-ref`, `for-each-ref`, `rev-list`, `config --get`). Because `git status` refreshes the index by default, every git invocation MUST run with optional locks disabled (`GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`) so that not even `.git/index` is rewritten. When agent sessions are enabled, the dashboard MAY start the user's configured agent in a session's worktree on the user's explicit request; what that agent changes is the agent's doing under its own permission prompts and is never done by the dashboard's own code. With agent sessions disabled the dashboard MUST NOT start any process that can modify a repository.

#### Scenario: No side effects
- **WHEN** a full scan runs across all tracked repos
- **THEN** no file under any tracked repository is created, modified or deleted

#### Scenario: Status does not refresh the index
- **WHEN** a scan runs `git status` in a repository whose index has stale stat information
- **THEN** the repository's `.git/index` file is byte-for-byte unchanged afterwards

#### Scenario: Preview and save have no side effects
- **WHEN** shared config profiles are saved and a preview is requested for every tracked repository
- **THEN** no file under any tracked repository is created, modified or deleted

#### Scenario: Apply touches exactly one file
- **WHEN** shared config profiles are applied to a repository
- **THEN** `openspec/config.yaml` is the only path under that repository that is created, modified or deleted

#### Scenario: Opening a session leaves the main checkout alone
- **WHEN** a session is opened for a change
- **THEN** the repository's checked-out branch and `git status` are unchanged, and no new file or directory appears in its working tree

#### Scenario: A refused session creates nothing
- **WHEN** opening a session is refused
- **THEN** no worktree and no branch is created

#### Scenario: Feature disabled means no processes
- **WHEN** agent sessions are disabled and any API request is made
- **THEN** no agent process is started and no repository is touched

#### Scenario: Discovery has no side effects
- **WHEN** discovery looks up the `origin` remote of candidates and configured repositories
- **THEN** no file under any of those repositories, including their git config, is created, modified or deleted
