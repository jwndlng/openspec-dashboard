## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Session starters run a fixed prompt for a validated change
The dashboard SHALL offer the starters **Draft artifacts** (while at least one artifact of the change is not done), **Implement** (change in `Ready` or `Implementing`) and **Archive** (change in `Done` or `Synced`), each only when the repository's agent has an opening prompt configured for it, and none for archived changes. A request to start a starter that is not available for the change's current stage SHALL be refused. The opening prompt SHALL be produced from the profile's template, in which `{change}` is the only placeholder, replaced by the change name after it passed change-name validation. The agent MUST be started without a shell from an argument list; the prompt MUST reach it either as exactly one argument (where the command contains `{prompt}`) or by being submitted to its terminal after start-up under the rules for text sent on the user's behalf (where it does not). No text from the browser other than the validated change name may become part of the command line.

The preconfigured profile's Archive prompt SHALL instruct the agent to sync the change's delta specs into the main specs and then archive the change, without asking whether to sync, and to archive right away when nothing is left to sync. It SHALL remain an ordinary prompt template the user can edit or remove. A saved configuration whose preconfigured profile still carries the former preconfigured Archive prompt verbatim (`/opsx:archive {change}`) SHALL be read as carrying the current one; any other Archive prompt, and a removed one, SHALL be left as saved. Syncing and archiving are done by the agent in the session's working directory; the dashboard itself MUST NOT write specs or move a change.

A starter that does not result in a session MUST NOT fail silently. When starting is refused or fails, the dashboard SHALL show the reason to the user in the place the starter was activated from, without requiring a session panel to be open — a session that could not be created has no panel to report itself in. The message SHALL be the reason the request was refused with. It SHALL be cleared once a later start from the same place succeeds.

#### Scenario: Implement on a ready change
- **WHEN** the user starts **Implement** on change `cache-api-calls` with the preconfigured profile
- **THEN** the agent is started with the argument list `claude`, `/opsx:apply cache-api-calls`

#### Scenario: Shell metacharacters are inert
- **WHEN** a profile's prompt template produces text containing quotes, `;` or `$(…)`
- **THEN** the agent receives that text as one argument and no shell interprets it

#### Scenario: Agent without a prompt for a starter
- **WHEN** a repository's agent has no Archive prompt and a change is in `Done`
- **THEN** no Archive starter is offered for it

#### Scenario: Command without a prompt placeholder
- **WHEN** an agent's command does not contain `{prompt}` and the agent shows its text prompt after start-up
- **THEN** the agent is started as given and the opening prompt is typed into its terminal and submitted with a separate Enter once the agent shows it

#### Scenario: Agent starts with a dialog instead of a prompt
- **WHEN** an agent whose opening prompt is typed shows a first-run dialog with a highlighted option after start-up
- **THEN** no Enter is pressed and the dialog is left for the user to answer in the terminal

#### Scenario: Invalid change name
- **WHEN** a session is requested for a change name containing characters outside the allowed set
- **THEN** the request is refused, no worktree is created and no process is started

#### Scenario: Archive on a synced change
- **WHEN** change `cache-api-calls` is in `Synced` and the repository's agent has an Archive prompt
- **THEN** the Archive starter is offered for it, and starting it opens an archive session

#### Scenario: Archive is refused before every task is done
- **WHEN** an Archive session is requested for a change in `Implementing`
- **THEN** the request is refused, no worktree is created and no process is started

#### Scenario: Preconfigured Archive prompt syncs without asking
- **WHEN** the user starts **Archive** on change `cache-api-calls` with the preconfigured profile
- **THEN** the agent is started with two arguments, `claude` and one prompt that begins with `/opsx:archive cache-api-calls` and tells it to sync the delta specs before archiving without asking

#### Scenario: Former preconfigured Archive prompt is upgraded
- **WHEN** a saved configuration's `claude` profile has the Archive prompt `/opsx:archive {change}`
- **THEN** the loaded configuration carries the current preconfigured Archive prompt for that profile

#### Scenario: Edited Archive prompt is kept
- **WHEN** a saved configuration's `claude` profile has the Archive prompt `/opsx:archive {change} and ask me before syncing`
- **THEN** the loaded configuration carries exactly that prompt

#### Scenario: A refused start is reported on the card
- **WHEN** the user activates a starter and the request is refused, so that no session is created
- **THEN** the card that starter belongs to shows the reason, and no session panel is required for it to be visible

#### Scenario: The reason goes away on the next successful start
- **WHEN** a starter was refused, its reason is shown, and a later start from the same card succeeds
- **THEN** the reason is no longer shown

### Requirement: Every session works in its own git worktree, created by the dashboard
In a git repository a session MUST NOT run in the repository's main checkout. Before starting the agent, the dashboard SHALL ensure a git worktree for the session under `~/.openspec-dashboard/worktrees/<repository id>/`, outside the repository's working tree, on branch `feat/<change>` — or, for **Archive**, in a worktree and branch of its own (`archive-<change>`, `chore/archive-<change>`). An existing worktree for that name SHALL be reused; an existing branch SHALL be checked out; otherwise the branch SHALL be created from the repository's default branch as currently known locally (`origin/HEAD`, else `HEAD`). As the one exception, when a Draft or Implement session's branch `feat/<change>` is already checked out in another linked worktree of the repository, the session SHALL adopt that worktree — run the agent there instead of creating one — and SHALL record and show that the worktree was adopted. The dashboard MUST NOT contact a remote for this. If the change's directory is missing from the session's worktree, the dashboard SHALL copy it from the checkout the change's data comes from (the main checkout or a linked worktree), including when it exists there only uncommitted. The main checkout's branch, index and working tree MUST NOT be changed. The session record and panel SHALL show the worktree path and branch.

A tracked folder that holds an `openspec/` tree but is **not a git repository** is a supported repository, and its sessions SHALL run **in place**: the agent's working directory SHALL be the repository folder itself, no worktree SHALL be created, no branch SHALL be made, and no git command SHALL be run for the session. Whether a session runs in place SHALL be decided from the repository's own scan result, never by attempting a git command and reacting to its failure. An in-place session SHALL be recorded as such and MUST NOT carry a branch. The panel SHALL name the folder the agent runs in and SHALL state plainly that the agent edits the tracked folder directly, with no branch, no commit and no undo. Session starters MUST NOT be hidden or disabled because a repository is not a git repository.

#### Scenario: Two sessions in one repository
- **WHEN** sessions are open for changes `audit-trail` and `upgrade-runtime` of the same repository
- **THEN** they run in two different worktrees on two different branches and the main checkout's branch and `git status` are unchanged

#### Scenario: Uncommitted change directory
- **WHEN** a session is opened for a change whose directory exists only uncommitted in the main checkout
- **THEN** the worktree contains a copy of that directory before the agent starts

#### Scenario: Change lives only in another worktree on another branch
- **WHEN** a session is opened for change `audit-trail`, which exists only in a worktree on branch `wip/compliance`
- **THEN** a session worktree on `feat/audit-trail` is created and contains a copy of the change directory from that worktree before the agent starts

#### Scenario: The change's branch is already checked out
- **WHEN** an Implement session is opened for change `audit-trail` and branch `feat/audit-trail` is checked out in a linked worktree that the user created
- **THEN** the agent runs in that worktree, no new worktree is created, and the panel shows the worktree as adopted

#### Scenario: Archiving does not reuse the implementation worktree
- **WHEN** a change was implemented in a session whose worktree still exists, and the user later starts **Archive** for it
- **THEN** the archive session runs in a separate worktree on a `chore/archive-<change>` branch

#### Scenario: Worktree cannot be created
- **WHEN** git refuses to create the worktree in a git repository
- **THEN** the request fails with git's reason and no agent is started

#### Scenario: Archiving a change in a folder that is not a git repository
- **WHEN** the user starts **Archive** for a completed change in a tracked folder that has an `openspec/` tree but no `.git`
- **THEN** the agent starts with the tracked folder as its working directory, no worktree and no branch are created, and no git command is run for the session

#### Scenario: The panel names the folder for an in-place session
- **WHEN** the panel of an in-place session is open
- **THEN** it names the repository folder the agent runs in, shows no branch, and states that the agent edits that folder directly with no branch, no commit and no undo

### Requirement: Worktree clean-up is offered only when safe
When ending or cleaning up a session, or for a worktree that has no session record, the dashboard SHALL offer to remove the worktree only if the dashboard created it, it has no uncommitted changes, and either its work status is `merged` or it has no commits that exist nowhere else (nothing ahead of its upstream, or, without an upstream, no commit that is unreachable from every other local or remote-tracking branch). Removal SHALL happen only after the user confirms, by a non-forcing `git worktree remove`; the branch is never deleted. Otherwise the worktree MUST be kept and the reason shown. A worktree MUST NOT be removed while a session is running in it. A worktree that a session adopted MUST NOT be offered for removal and MUST NOT be removed by the dashboard. An in-place session has no worktree: removal MUST NOT be offered for it, and ending it SHALL end the agent and nothing else.

#### Scenario: Unpushed work
- **WHEN** the user ends a session whose worktree has commits that exist only on its branch
- **THEN** removal is not offered, the worktree is kept, and the panel explains why

#### Scenario: Clean worktree
- **WHEN** the worktree is clean, its commits exist elsewhere, and the user confirms removal
- **THEN** the worktree is removed

#### Scenario: Squash-merged and the remote branch is gone
- **WHEN** the worktree is clean, its work status is `merged`, its upstream no longer exists, and the user confirms removal
- **THEN** the worktree is removed and its local branch still exists

#### Scenario: Adopted worktree
- **WHEN** the user ends a session that adopted a worktree the user had created, and that worktree is clean
- **THEN** removal is not offered and the worktree is kept

#### Scenario: Ending an in-place session
- **WHEN** the user ends a session that ran in a folder that is not a git repository
- **THEN** the dialog offers neither a worktree removal nor a pull, and confirming ends the agent and leaves the folder untouched

### Requirement: Ship asks the agent to commit, push and open a pull request
For a session whose worktree has status `uncommitted`, `unpushed` or `pushed` the dashboard SHALL offer a Ship action. It uses the agent profile's Ship prompt, or an agent-neutral default asking to commit with a conventional message, push the branch, open a pull request against the default branch if none exists, not to merge it, and to report its URL. When the session is running the prompt SHALL be submitted to its terminal under the rules for text sent on the user's behalf, so that one activation sends it; otherwise the agent SHALL be started in the session's worktree — with its resume command and the prompt submitted after start-up when it has one, else with its command and the prompt as opening prompt — in the same session record, under the same checks as resuming. The result of Ship SHALL state whether the prompt was submitted, and when it was only typed the panel SHALL say so. The dashboard itself MUST NOT commit, push, or contact a remote. An in-place session has no worktree and no branch: it has no work status, Ship MUST NOT be offered for it, and a Ship request for it SHALL be refused.

#### Scenario: Ship in a running session
- **WHEN** Ship is used on a running session whose agent waits at its text prompt
- **THEN** the Ship prompt is typed, shown by the agent, submitted with a separate Enter, the agent starts working on it, and no process is started

#### Scenario: Ship while the agent shows a menu
- **WHEN** Ship is used on a running session whose agent shows a selection menu
- **THEN** no Enter is pressed, nothing is confirmed, and the panel says that the Ship prompt was typed but not sent

#### Scenario: Ship after the session ended
- **WHEN** Ship is used on an ended session of an agent with a resume command
- **THEN** the agent is started with the resume command in the session's worktree, the prompt is submitted to it after start-up, and the session is `running` again

#### Scenario: Nothing to ship
- **WHEN** Ship is requested for a session whose worktree is `merged`, `clean` or `missing`
- **THEN** the request is refused and nothing is started

#### Scenario: Ship is not offered without git
- **WHEN** the panel of an in-place session is open
- **THEN** no Ship control is shown, no work status is shown for it, and a Ship request for that session is refused
