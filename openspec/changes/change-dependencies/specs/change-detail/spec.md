# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Detail header shows the change's state
The detail view SHALL show, above the artifacts: the change name in monospace, the repository name linking to that repository's board, a close control, and every warning the snapshot carries for the change. Below them it SHALL show the change's state and whereabouts that the card on the board leaves out: its column; its task progress as a bar with `done/total` when tasks exist; the relative age of its last activity, or its archive date when archived; how long it has been complete when it is in `Done` or `Synced`; its branch badge when `branchMatch` is set, whose tooltip names the worktree the data comes from and lists the other checkouts holding a copy with their branch and column; for an archive found only in a linked worktree, a badge naming the branch that holds it and stating that the main checkout does not have it yet, with a tooltip listing the checkouts still holding an active copy and how to resolve it; when agent sessions apply and a session worktree exists for the change, the work-status badge (uncommitted files, commits not pushed, `pushed` or `merged`, highlighted as stale by the same rules as before), which opens the change's Console tab; the text of its `prompt.md`, without the heading the create form writes, as plain text that scrolls when long; when the change declares dependencies, a *Depends on* list giving each dependency's name and its state in words (`met`, `waiting`, `missing`, `cycle`), headed by whether the change is blocked; and when other active changes depend on it, a *Required by* list of their names. Every name in either list that is a change in the snapshot SHALL link to that change's detail view; a `missing` name SHALL be shown as text, not a link. Status SHALL be conveyed by text as well as colour. All of these SHALL come from the existing snapshot; the detail view MUST NOT introduce facts about a change that the snapshot does not carry, and it SHALL NOT show the change's creation date or schema. For a change that is gone from the snapshot but whose worktree remains, the header SHALL show only its name, the repository and the close control.

#### Scenario: Header content
- **WHEN** a change `cloud-deployment` of repository `demo-ops` is in `Implementing` with `tasks 4/12`, created `2026-03-02`, last activity 3 days ago and `branchMatch: feat/cloud-deployment`
- **THEN** the header shows `cloud-deployment`, `demo-ops` as a link to that repository's board, a close control, `Implementing`, a progress bar with `4/12`, `updated 3d ago` and the branch badge `feat/cloud-deployment`, and shows neither the creation date nor the schema

#### Scenario: Worktree and other checkouts
- **WHEN** `audit-trail` is `Implementing` in a worktree on `feat/audit-trail` and `Drafts` in the main checkout
- **THEN** its detail header shows the badge `feat/audit-trail`, whose tooltip names the worktree path and lists the main checkout with `Drafts`

#### Scenario: Work status
- **WHEN** a change's session has ended and its worktree holds 3 uncommitted files
- **THEN** the detail header shows "3 uncommitted", and activating it opens the Console tab

#### Scenario: Pending archive
- **WHEN** `audit-trail` is archived only in a worktree on `chore/archive-audit-trail`
- **THEN** its detail header names `chore/archive-audit-trail` and says the main checkout does not have the archive yet

#### Scenario: Prompt
- **WHEN** the change has a `prompt.md` reading `# Prompt`, an empty line and `Log every mutation`
- **THEN** the header shows `Log every mutation` as plain text, without the heading

#### Scenario: Warnings are surfaced
- **WHEN** the snapshot carries a warning for the change
- **THEN** the warning text is shown in the header

#### Scenario: Archived change
- **WHEN** the detail view is open for an archived change
- **THEN** its artifacts are shown like any other change's, and the header shows its archive date

#### Scenario: Depends on
- **WHEN** the detail view is open for `add-billing-ui`, which depends on `add-billing-schema` (`met`) and `add-billing-api` (`waiting`)
- **THEN** the header says the change is blocked and lists `add-billing-schema — met` and `add-billing-api — waiting`, each linking to that change's detail view

#### Scenario: Required by
- **WHEN** the detail view is open for `add-billing-api`, and `add-billing-ui` and `add-billing-docs` depend on it
- **THEN** the header lists `add-billing-docs` and `add-billing-ui` under *Required by*, each linking to its detail view

#### Scenario: Missing dependency
- **WHEN** a change depends on `add-billing-scheme` and no such change exists
- **THEN** the *Depends on* list shows `add-billing-scheme — missing` as text without a link, and the header shows the warning naming it

#### Scenario: No dependencies
- **WHEN** a change declares no dependencies and nothing depends on it
- **THEN** the header shows neither list
