## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Every session worktree has a work status
For every directory under `~/.openspec-dashboard/worktrees/<repoId>/` of a configured repository the dashboard SHALL derive a work status from local git, using read-only commands and without contacting a remote. The base is the repository's default branch as locally known (`origin/HEAD`), or the main checkout's `HEAD` when there is none. The status SHALL be the first that applies: `missing` when the directory is not a git worktree; `uncommitted` with the number of changed or untracked files; `merged` when the branch has no commit that the base lacks and a remote-tracking branch of the same name exists, or when every file the branch changed has the same content in the base (which also recognises squash and rebase merges); `clean` when the branch has no commit that the base lacks; `unpushed` with the number of commits ahead of its upstream, or all commits the base lacks when it has no upstream; otherwise `pushed`. Statuses MAY be cached for up to 15 seconds and MUST be recomputed after a session ends, a Ship action or a worktree removal. Because nothing is fetched, `merged` reflects the user's last fetch; the UI MUST say so.

#### Scenario: Uncommitted files
- **WHEN** a session's worktree contains two modified files and one untracked file
- **THEN** its work status is `uncommitted` with a count of 3

#### Scenario: Committed but not pushed
- **WHEN** the worktree is clean and its branch has two commits and no upstream
- **THEN** its work status is `unpushed` with a count of 2

#### Scenario: Pushed
- **WHEN** the worktree is clean and its branch equals its upstream but the base lacks its commits and content
- **THEN** its work status is `pushed`

#### Scenario: Squash-merged
- **WHEN** the base contains one commit with the same file content as the branch's three commits
- **THEN** its work status is `merged`

#### Scenario: Worktree without a session record
- **WHEN** a session's record is deleted while its worktree holds uncommitted files
- **THEN** the worktree is still listed with status `uncommitted`

#### Scenario: No network
- **WHEN** work statuses are computed
- **THEN** no git command that contacts a remote is run

### Requirement: Ship asks the agent to commit, push and open a pull request
For a session whose worktree has status `uncommitted`, `unpushed` or `pushed` the dashboard SHALL offer a Ship action. It uses the agent profile's Ship prompt, or an agent-neutral default asking to commit with a conventional message, push the branch, open a pull request against the default branch if none exists, not to merge it, and to report its URL. When the session is running the prompt SHALL be typed into its terminal; otherwise the agent SHALL be started in the session's worktree — with its resume command and the prompt typed after start-up when it has one, else with its command and the prompt as opening prompt — in the same session record, under the same checks as resuming. The dashboard itself MUST NOT commit, push, or contact a remote.

#### Scenario: Ship in a running session
- **WHEN** Ship is used on a running session
- **THEN** the Ship prompt followed by Enter is written to the terminal and no process is started

#### Scenario: Ship after the session ended
- **WHEN** Ship is used on an ended session of an agent with a resume command
- **THEN** the agent is started with the resume command in the session's worktree, the prompt is typed into it, and the session is `running` again

#### Scenario: Nothing to ship
- **WHEN** Ship is requested for a session whose worktree is `merged`, `clean` or `missing`
- **THEN** the request is refused and nothing is started

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Worktree clean-up is offered only when safe
When ending or cleaning up a session, or for a worktree that has no session record, the dashboard SHALL offer to remove the worktree only if it has no uncommitted changes and either its work status is `merged` or it has no commits that exist nowhere else (nothing ahead of its upstream, or, without an upstream, no commit that is unreachable from every other local or remote-tracking branch). Removal SHALL happen only after the user confirms, by a non-forcing `git worktree remove`; the branch is never deleted. Otherwise the worktree MUST be kept and the reason shown. A worktree MUST NOT be removed while a session is running in it.

#### Scenario: Unpushed work
- **WHEN** the user ends a session whose worktree has commits that exist only on its branch
- **THEN** removal is not offered, the worktree is kept, and the panel explains why

#### Scenario: Clean worktree
- **WHEN** the worktree is clean, its commits exist elsewhere, and the user confirms removal
- **THEN** the worktree is removed

#### Scenario: Squash-merged and the remote branch is gone
- **WHEN** the worktree is clean, its work status is `merged`, its upstream no longer exists, and the user confirms removal
- **THEN** the worktree is removed and its local branch still exists
