## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Cards show repository, name, progress, activity and branch
Each card SHALL display the change name in monospace, a progress bar with `done/total` when tasks exist, the relative age of `lastActivityAt` (e.g. "3d ago"), and a branch badge when `branchMatch` is set. On the combined board each card SHALL also display the repository name; on a single-repository board the repository name SHALL be omitted from cards. Cards in `Done` SHALL additionally show how long the change has been complete.

#### Scenario: Card content
- **WHEN** a change `cloud-deployment` in repo `demo-ops` has `tasks 30/30`, last activity 12 days ago and no branch match, and is shown on the combined board
- **THEN** the card shows `demo-ops`, `cloud-deployment`, a full progress bar labelled `30/30`, `12d ago`, and no branch badge

#### Scenario: Card on a repository board
- **WHEN** the same change is shown on the board for repository `demo-ops`
- **THEN** the card shows `cloud-deployment`, the progress bar, `12d ago` and the copy action, but not the repository name
