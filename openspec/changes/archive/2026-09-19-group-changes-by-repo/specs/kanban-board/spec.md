## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Cards are grouped by repository within each column
Within every column, including the expanded `Archived` column, the board SHALL group cards by repository: all cards of one repository SHALL be adjacent, under a group header showing the repository name and the number of cards in that group. Groups SHALL be ordered by repository name, case-insensitively, and the order SHALL be the same in every column. Within a group, cards SHALL keep the order they would have had without grouping. A repository with no visible cards in a column SHALL NOT produce a group there. Column counts SHALL remain the total number of cards in the column. Grouping SHALL be applied after filtering, and in the `Archived` column after selecting the most recently archived changes, so it never changes which cards are shown.

#### Scenario: Two repositories in one column
- **WHEN** the `Implementing` column contains changes `a1` and `a2` from repository `alpha` and `b1` from repository `beta`, scanned in the order `a1`, `b1`, `a2`
- **THEN** the column shows a group `alpha` with count `2` containing `a1` then `a2`, followed by a group `beta` with count `1` containing `b1`, and the column count is `3`

#### Scenario: Same group order across columns
- **WHEN** repositories `zeta` and `Alpha` both have cards in `Design` and in `Done`
- **THEN** the `Alpha` group is above the `zeta` group in both columns

#### Scenario: No empty groups
- **WHEN** repository `beta` has no cards in the `Ready` column
- **THEN** the `Ready` column shows no `beta` group header

#### Scenario: Filtered-out repository
- **WHEN** the repository filter selects only `alpha`
- **THEN** every column shows at most one group, `alpha`, and its header count equals the number of visible `alpha` cards in that column

#### Scenario: Archived column keeps its bound
- **WHEN** 96 changes are archived across repositories and the `Archived` column is expanded
- **THEN** the 25 most recently archived changes are shown, grouped by repository, with each group's cards in archive-date descending order, and the column header still reports the total of `96`

### Requirement: Each repository has its own stable colour
The board SHALL assign every repository in the snapshot a colour derived deterministically from its repository id, without any configuration. The assignment SHALL be computed over all repositories in the snapshot, independent of the active filters, so that the same set of tracked repositories always yields the same colours across reloads, scans and filter changes. Repositories tracked at the same time SHALL receive distinct colours for up to 24 repositories. The repository colour SHALL be shown on the repository's group header, as an accent on each of its cards including the card's repository label, and on its repository filter chip. The colour SHALL adapt to the active theme so that repository-coloured text keeps a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background in every supported theme. Colour MUST NOT be the only cue: wherever a repository colour is shown, the repository name SHALL be shown with it. The error styling of a repository filter chip SHALL take precedence over its repository colour.

#### Scenario: Distinct colours
- **WHEN** 17 repositories are tracked
- **THEN** no two of them have the same colour

#### Scenario: Stable across reload and rescan
- **WHEN** the page is reloaded or a scan completes and the set of tracked repositories is unchanged
- **THEN** every repository has the same colour as before

#### Scenario: Filters do not change colours
- **WHEN** the user filters the board to repository `vcs-admin` only
- **THEN** `vcs-admin` cards, group headers and filter chip keep the colour they had with no filter applied

#### Scenario: Colour is consistent across the board
- **WHEN** repository `beta-soc` has cards in three columns
- **THEN** its group headers, the accent and repository label on all of its cards, and its filter chip all use the same colour, each alongside the name `beta-soc`

#### Scenario: Theme change
- **WHEN** the user switches from the dark to the light theme
- **THEN** each repository keeps the same hue, and repository-coloured text remains legible (contrast ≥ 4.5:1) on the light backgrounds

#### Scenario: Repository in error
- **WHEN** a tracked repository failed to scan
- **THEN** its filter chip shows the error styling rather than its repository colour
