// The console's terminal gets its height from a chain of flex containers, not from any explicit size: the pane fills
// the detail content, the terminal fills what the pane's header leaves, and the terminal's host is absolutely
// positioned inside it. A `flex: 1` only resolves against a parent that is itself a flex container, so if any link in
// that chain stops being one the terminal collapses to nothing — its host contributes no height — and the console
// renders as a few pixels of frame. That is what happened when the dock's `.session-pane` rule was removed along with
// the dock while `ConsolePanel` still relied on it, so the chain is asserted here rather than left to a screenshot.
