// The contract every spec-driven framework module implements (spec-frameworks spec; support-spec-frameworks design D1).
//
// A module tells the framework-neutral server where a framework keeps its files and how one change reads in the one
// shape the board uses (`FrameworkChange`); `shared/columns.ts` derives stage and column from that shape alone. A module
// only reads: it lists, reads and resolves paths through a `RepoSource`, and for writes it supplies paths and file
// contents that the enumerated writers (`createChange.ts`, `dismissChange.ts`, …) use — never a write of its own.
