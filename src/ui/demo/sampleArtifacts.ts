  return `## Why

Today ${words(c.name)} is handled by hand, which is slow and easy to get wrong. This change makes it a supported, tested part of the system.

## What Changes

- Introduce **${words(c.name)}** behind a configuration switch
- Document the behaviour in the \`${c.name}\` capability
- Non-goals: migrating existing data, changing public APIs

## Impact

| Area | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Code | one new module, two call sites |
| Operations | one new setting, off by default |
| Docs | a new how-to page |

function spec(c: ChangeSnapshot, capability: string): string {
  return `## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: ${title(capability)}

The system SHALL support ${words(capability)} and MUST keep the previous behaviour when the feature is switched off.

#### Scenario: Switched on

- **WHEN** the feature is enabled and a request arrives
- **THEN** it is handled by the new path

#### Scenario: Switched off

- **WHEN** the feature is disabled
- **THEN** nothing changes for existing users

<!-- part of change ${c.name} -->

}

function design(c: ChangeSnapshot): string {
  return `# Design

## Context

See \`proposal.md\`. The existing code has one natural seam for ${words(c.name)}.

## Decisions

### D1 — Keep it behind a switch

1. Ship dark, enable per environment
2. Remove the switch once it has been on for a release
   - the old path is deleted in the same change
   - the setting is kept as a no-op for one more release

\`\`\`yaml
features:
  ${c.name}: false   # default
\`\`\`

> Alternative considered: a long-lived branch. Rejected, it would drift.

## Risks

- *Rollout order matters* → documented in the runbook, see [the deployment guide](https://example.com/docs/deploy).
